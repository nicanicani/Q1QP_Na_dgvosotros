        <h1>Study Background</h1>
        <p>The reason as to why our group decided to choose this topic is because Shire and I adore K-pop and love listening to it. We both buy albums of our favorite group and display them.
            Our other groupmate on the otherhand doesn't like K-pop that much as much as Shire and I do. So when the time came for us to choose a topic, Shire suggested that we use K-pop album sales. I agreed thinking it was a great idea.
            Kate, our other groupmate, also agreed just so that she could have a grade and we could have a topic right away. After we dicussed our topic with Ma'am Camille we then went straight to researching about the top 50 albums in the year 2022.
            So that is basically how we ended up choosing this topic. We tried to think of other topics but when we started researching about this topic Shire and I loved the results since our favorite groups were there so we decided to push through with the topic.
